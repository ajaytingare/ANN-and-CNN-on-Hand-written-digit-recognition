# ANN-and-CNN-on-Hand-written-digit-recognition
This repository, titled "ANN and CNN on Hand-written Digit Recognition," showcases a comparative analysis of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the MNIST dataset. It explores how each model performs in recognizing hand-written digits, with a focus on accuracy, model architecture, and processing efficiency.
